{{< figure src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Author photo" class="avatar centered">}}

I’m a freelance software engineer based in France. I specialize in scientific programming, high performance computing, and cloud computing. I also have a strong interest in data visualization. I have had the chance to work with organizations in a wide variety of domains: geophysics, hydrology, climate modelling, aeronautics, medical imaging…

I was formerly a software engineer at [Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com) where I worked for 6 years on the development of performance critical geophysical algorithms.
